# Bike Sharing Analysis Assignment
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes aspires to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## File Information
- README.md - This is the readme file giving a brief about the project.
- Sabhrant_Srivastava_Bike_Sharing_Analysis.ipynb - This file contains Python code used for data reading, cleansing, analysis and graph generation and various steps coded for building the multiple linear regression model for the assignment.
- Sabhrant_Srivastava_Bike_Sharing_Analysis.pdf - This file contains the answers to the general and assignment related questions asked in the assignment.
- data-dictionary.txt - This file contains the desciption about the data.
- day.csv - This file contains the data on which analysis and linear regression model was built.

## Top 3 features affecting the bike demand are
- **Temperature**: Has a major impact on the demand, as the temp gets more pleasant that is when temperature increases it corresponds increase in bike demands.
- **Year**: We observe an increase in demand in year 2019 compared to year 2018.
- **Wind Speed**: Affects the target variable inversely. That means the demand for bikes comes when wind speed is high.
